# Decision log

Every decision a future agent would otherwise have to rediscover or re-litigate: the user's
answers, deviations from or clarifications of the spec, and non-obvious technical choices.

Format: `D-### — title` · date · status (`accepted (user)` = the user decided; `accepted` = agent
decided, within the spec; `proposed` = a later task confirms or refines it; `superseded by D-###`).
Append new entries; don't rewrite old ones. Supersede them instead.

## D-001 — UI stack: Preact 10 + TypeScript 6.0 + Vite 8

2026-10-03 · accepted (user)

- The user chose Preact + TS (over React, Svelte and vanilla). Core logic is framework-free
  TypeScript either way. Preact is only the thin UI layer, polished later.
- **Preact is pinned to 10.x on purpose.** Preact 11.0.0 shipped on 2026-09-30, but
  `@preact/preset-vite` 2.10.6 still depends on `@prefresh/vite` ^2.4, which predates 11.
  Upgrade once the preset moves to prefresh 4 (T3.5 or earlier).
- **TypeScript is pinned to ~6.0 on purpose.** TS 7.0 (the native port) is `latest` on npm,
  but typescript-eslint 8.x supports `typescript <6.1.0`. Typed lint rules such as
  `no-floating-promises` matter for async BLE code, so we keep the linter working.

## D-002 — Work directly on `main`, one task per agent session

2026-10-03 · accepted (user)

Each task is committed and pushed to `main` together with its plan update, so the next agent
(after a context clear) sees current state without merging anything. Every push to `main`
redeploys GitHub Pages. Protocol: `CLAUDE.md`.

## D-003 — Automatic export destination deferred

2026-10-03 · accepted (user)

The user chose to decide later (Q1). The export *format*, manual export and import go ahead
(T1.7). Automatic export (T1.20) is blocked on Q1, and the agent there asks again. Options put to
the user: commit JSON to a private GitHub repo via a fine-grained token (zero taps), or the iOS
share sheet after each session (one tap).

## D-004 — The raw layer stores verbatim notification bytes

2026-10-03 · accepted

- Each notification is stored as received: bytes, arrival time, source characteristic (FF11 or
  FF12) and a per-recording sequence number shared with app events. That includes frames with
  bad checksums, the wrong length or unknown headers.
- Parsed fields (weight, flow, battery, …) are *derived* by the decoder, and the decoder is
  cheap: 20 bytes per frame, about 10–20 Hz.
- Why: the spec says "record every packet … derive everything afterwards" and "re-run detection
  across the entire history". Several byte meanings are still unverified (sign and unit bytes,
  `03 0D` frames; see protocol-notes). With bytes as the source of truth, a decoder fix applies
  retroactively. Corruption rate also stays measurable.
- Spec parsing rule 1 ("discard failures silently") applies when *decoding* for analysis and
  the live display, not when recording.

## D-005 — Unknown unit byte: refuse to interpret, never stop recording

2026-10-03 · accepted

The decoder never throws. It reports `unitOk: false` when byte index 5 is not in
`GRAM_UNIT_BYTES`. The live display and analysis refuse such frames loudly (a visible error),
and the recorder keeps storing them. `GRAM_UNIT_BYTES` starts as `[0x01]` (the Ultra doc value)
until hardware test A9 confirms the Mini's value. This keeps the spec's "refuse loudly rather
than silently misinterpreting ounces" without letting a wrong guess about the byte lose data.

## D-006 — Timebase: device ms only where it advances

2026-10-03 · accepted

Spec rule 3 says to use the packet's ms field "wherever it is non-zero". That field is the
scale's stopwatch: it is zero until started and can sit **frozen at a non-zero value** after a
stop. So:

- Use device ms only on runs of frames where it strictly increases.
- Map each run onto the arrival clock using that run's minimum `arrival − device` offset (the
  least-delayed packet).
- Use arrival time everywhere else, and flag each sample's time source.
- Always record arrival time (rule 4).

T1.9 implements this. T1.16 checks it against real data.

## D-007 — A shot is a metadata entity anchored in a recording

2026-10-03 · proposed (T1.2 and T1.14 confirm)

- A **recording** is one connect-to-disconnect capture (raw). A **shot** is a user-owned
  metadata entity: grades, tags, dose and entity references, plus `recordingId` and an anchor
  time on that recording's timeline.
- Segmentation results are derived and disposable. They are matched to shots by anchor time.
  Re-running analysis with a new version never deletes or moves user metadata. A shot that no
  longer matches a segment is flagged, never dropped. A new segment with no shot gets one created
  (source `post-hoc`).
- Why: derived data is re-run across all history, and grades must survive that.

## D-008 — The command whitelist is the only way to talk to the scale

2026-10-03 · accepted

`src/core/protocol` exports named commands only:

- tare, buzzer level, auto-off, start/stop/reset timer, tare-and-start, flow smoothing off;
- keep-alive `0x25`, marked unverified.

There is no generic "encode sub-command N" function. Calibration (`0x09`) and shutdown (`0x15`)
are unrepresentable, and a test enumerates the whitelist to prove it. The Ultra-only `0x0B` and
`0x0D` stay out until verified on the Mini and approved by the user. Smoothing *on* is not
exposed either: its payload byte position has moved between doc revisions, and the spec wants
smoothing off.

## D-009 — Relative asset base and hash routing

2026-10-03 · accepted

`vite.config.ts` uses `base: './'` and the UI routes on the URL hash (`#/probe`, `#/history`).
The same build works under the GitHub Pages project path (`/smart-scale/`), on a custom domain,
from `vite preview`, and inside a future Capacitor shell, with no `404.html` SPA workaround.

## D-010 — ESLint enforces the architecture boundaries

2026-10-03 · accepted

- `src/core/**` may not import Preact or the outer layers (transport, storage, app, ui,
  platform), and may not use DOM globals.
- `src/core/analysis/**` may not import `src/core/live/**`. This is the spec's "the live filter
  must never reach stored analysis".
- `navigator.bluetooth` may be used only in `src/transport/**`.

Why: agents start with cleared context, so the linter remembers the spec's structural rules for
them. Configured in `eslint.config.js`.

## D-011 — Prettier formats code, not Markdown

2026-10-03 · accepted

Prettier is configured for TS, JS, JSON, CSS, HTML and YAML. `*.md` is ignored for two reasons:
re-aligned tables in `docs/PLAN.md` would turn every status change into a noisy diff, and
`docs/spec.md` must stay byte-identical to what the user supplied.

## D-012 — The in-app probe is the first deployable

2026-10-03 · accepted

T1.8 builds a diagnostics screen that runs in Bluefy. It connects, shows and records every
frame, sends whitelisted commands, takes annotations and exports recordings. It answers the
spec's Phase 0 questions in the real runtime, plus the runtime questions nRF Connect can't
answer (re-pairing, backgrounding, storage). Its recordings become the analysis fixtures. Doing
Phase 0 with nRF Connect or LightBlue remains valid for Part A of `docs/hardware-tests.md`.

## D-013 — Build against a simulator until real data exists

2026-10-03 · accepted

Analysis and live logic are developed against a deterministic shot simulator with ground truth
(T1.3). Their parameters are marked provisional until T1.16 tunes them on real fixtures.
Pump-marker detection (T1.13) waits for hardware test A2, because the spec says: "If vibration
does not survive into the weight signal, revise the segmentation section before any of it is
implemented."
